I got some XL pimple patches for a really gross cluster of zits that showed up on my cheekbone and i was blown away by how much the redness and swelling had gone down in 24 hours. Pimple patches are expensive though, and I was reading that they mainly work by protecting the zit and creating a moist environment that accelerates healing. Duh!! I never exactly skipped moisturizer but since my skin is so oily I tend to not think it's that important when my skin's not visibly flaky or irritated. I've been experimenting with both petroleum jelly and fractionated coconut oil (caprylic/capric triglyceride) on my pimples that have started to harden/scab and I'm really blown away by how quickly they start to flatten out and lighten. Just wanted to rave about this because I feel like this aspect is not talked about quite as much in the acne cycle - I'll have periods of time where I'm not getting that many new/active breakouts, but once it clicked for me that I'm basically walking around with a bunch of little open wounds on my face and body, that keep getting inflamed and spreading bacteria around from (pretty much unavoidable) friction, I actually have some hope that I can get a handle on this! On new/active zits I tend to skip tret on those areas since it doesn't seem to do all that much and use either Lion Pair Cream (pissed about these new tariffs cuz my dad borrows it too ) or Thayer's 10% sulfur spot treatment."}
